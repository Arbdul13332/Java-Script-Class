 DECLARATION OF VARIABLES AND CONSTANT

variables are data containers whr the values can be changed
variables are declared with the "LET" keyword, eg let userName = 'DAVE'

constant are also data containers where the vaules can'ts be changed
constants are declared using the "const" keywords, eg const circle = 360
# Functions
functions are reffered to as code on demand because the code doesnt get to run immediately, 
it runs when it is been called and it could be the first code but the last action on the app.
 it is defined with 
"function homeButtonClick(onclick){
alert("this is a fnction")
}"
