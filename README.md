Java-Script-Class
# what i've learned soo far on java script
# CHAPTER ONE 
introduction to javascript
javascript is a dynamic and weakly typed interpreted programming language and compiled on runtime 
it is built to be executed in a browser  with engine v8 (chrome) and and spidermonkey (firefox) 
which does the parsing and interpretation of code, javascript was later extracted and became node.js
and can be executed on any machine, it can be used to build web backends and can interact with the operationg machine 

# Difference between Java and javascript
Java is OBJECT ORIENTED AND STRONGLY TYPED
Javascript is flexible and weakly typed

# OTHERS
we were thought how to follow the course and make use of the materials and participate in the assignments

# CHAPTER 2
how to Add javascript
1. <script src="fileLocation"></script>
2. <script> alert("this is javascript") </script>

 DECLARATION OF VARIABLES AND CONSTANT

variables are data containers whr the values can be changed
variables are declared with the "LET" keyword, eg let userName = 'DAVE'

constant are also data containers where the vaules can'ts be changed
constants are declared using the "const" keywords, eg const circle = 360
# Functions
functions are reffered to as code on demand because the code doesnt get to run immediately, 
it runs when it is been called and it could be the first code but the last action on the app.
 it is defined with 
 FOR DECLARATION:
"function homeButtonClick(onclick){
alert("this is a fnction");
}"
FOR CALLING A FUNCTION:
functionName(parameters);

# CODE STYLE AND SYNTAX
this section educates on writting a code that would be easy to 
read by someone else,by the appropriate use of whitespaces 
eg:
WITHOUT WHITESPACE:
function anExample(noWhiteSpace){ alert("didnt make use of whitespace")} 

WITH WHITESPACE:
function aExample(with whitespace) {
alert("made use of whitespace")
}
SYNTAX
when you make a mistake or forgot to add an component or a step
while coding 

RETURN KEYWORD: used to return a value and no action can be taken after
the return keyword has been declared

parsing of a string to a number uisng the parseInt/ parseFloat keyword 
better still '+ +' can be used instead
